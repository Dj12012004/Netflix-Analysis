# Project overview 

Netflix has grown into the world’s largest streaming service, offering a vast library of movies, TV shows, and documentaries across multiple genres and countries. With such a huge dataset, it becomes essential to analyze the content in order to gain insights into viewer trends, content distribution, and catalog patterns.

In this project, I used SQL to explore and analyze Netflix’s dataset. 

The workflow included:
* Setting up Schema , setting the schema for storing Netflix's Data
* Manually loading the data , importing the dataset into MySql Database.
* SQL Analysis , writing and executing 10 key business problems.

This analysis helps uncover trends in Netflix’s catalog, including the distribution of movies vs. TV shows, most common ratings, genre diversity, and content availability by country.
