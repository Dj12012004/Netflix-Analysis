# Project overview 

Netflix has grown into the world’s largest streaming service, offering a vast library of movies, TV shows, and documentaries across multiple genres and countries. With such a huge dataset, it becomes essential to analyze the content in order to gain insights into viewer trends, content distribution, and catalog patterns.

In this project, I used SQL to explore and analyze Netflix’s dataset. 

The Workflow included :
* Setting up Schema , setting the schema for storing Netflix's Data. (File)
* Manually loading the data , importing the dataset into MySql Database. (File)
* SQL Analysis , writing and executing 10 key business problems. (File)


This analysis helps uncover trends in Netflix’s catalog, including the distribution of movies vs. TV shows, most common ratings, genre diversity, and content availability by country.


# Business Problems Covered 
**1. Count the Number of Movies vs. TV Shows** - Understand the overall distribution of content types.

**2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows** - Identify the most frequent content rating (eg TV-MA, PG-13) separately for movies and TV shows.

**3. List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (eg 2020)** - Filter movies by release year to track yearly trends.

**4. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix** - Identify which countries produce the largest share of Netflix content.

**5. Identify the Longest Movie** - Find the movie with the longest runtime in the catalog.

**6. Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years** - Check the pace at which Netflix is adding new content.

**7. List All TV Shows with More Than 5 Seasons** - Analyze long-running TV shows and franchises available on the platform.

**8. Count the Number of Content Items in Each Genre** - Measure the distribution of content across genres (drama, comedy, documentaries, etc.).

**9. List All Movies That Are Documentaries** - Specifically filter for documentary films.

**10. Find All Content Without a Director** - Identify incomplete metadata where the director field is missing.


# Key Findings & Conclusion
* Through this SQL analysis of the Netflix dataset, we were able to:
* Compare the distribution between movies and TV shows.
* Discover the most common ratings that cater to Netflix’s audience.
* Identify country-level contributions, with certain countries dominating the content pool.
* Highlight the longest running TV shows and the longest movie.
* Understand genre diversity and the availability of documentaries.
* Detect metadata gaps, such as missing director information.

  This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used for business intelligence in the media industry. The insights gained here can support content strategy, audience targeting, and data driven decision making for streaming services.
